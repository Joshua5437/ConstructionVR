Primary Contributors    - Cody Armand & Joshua Cotton

Device Compatibility    - HTC Vive Pro 

Development Environment - Unity (C#)


Description: 

This program was designed as part of a research project to study and promote porper ergonomic habits when lifting and moving materials in a construction envrionment. The program has been designed as a 15-20 minute interactivew experience on the HTC Vive in which the user will be presented with examples of two common scenarios with porper ergonomics. The user will then be expected to repeat those examples themselves using basic VR interactions to mimic picking up and placing down various objects. Eventually, the hope is that the program will eventually be able to utilize standard motion trackers to track the user's actual posture and inform the user if his or her posture is incorrect.
